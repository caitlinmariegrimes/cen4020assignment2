4. Branching allows multiple features or updates to the codebase to be developed
simultaneously with changes to one branch not impacting the other branches until
they are merged.

5. git status shows the current state of the repository while git log shows
snapshots of the history of the repository. 

6. git log -- Vehicle.h

7. git log --grep="file"

  i.   Inheritance occurs when the derived or "child" class inherits the member
       variables or functions of the base or "parent" class. 
  ii.  Polymorphism occurs when functions are overloaded or overridden such that
       an object must decide which function definition to implement.
  iii. Encapsulation is a method of information-hiding that utilizes access
       modifiers to restrict access to member variables and functions of a class
       such that those member variables and functions are either 
       -  private (only accessible within the current class),
       -  protected (accessible within the current class, by all classes within 
          the current package, and by subclasses of the current class within 
          other packages), or
       -  public (accessible to the current class and all other classes).

9. The Dictator and Lieutenants workflow is similar to the Integration Manager
   workflow but includes an additional level of oversite. The Lieutenants are
   similar to integration managers to which most developers report, and the
   dictator is the integration manager over all the other integration managers
   (aka. Lieutenants).

10. The Dictator and Lieutenants workflow is better suited to large projects than
    the Centralized workflow because it incorporates more structure and oversight.
    A team of 100 developers would benefit from the Dictator and Lieutenants
    workflow over the Centralized workflow. With the former, each individual is
    pulling and pushing from one shared repository that would likely get very
    hard to manage very quickly. With the latter, they instead pull changes from 
    a centrally managed respository and push their changes to their "lieutenants" 
    for review and conflict resolution. The lieutenants push their code to the
    overarching dictator for final review and merge to the central repository. The
    additional oversight and structure enables more efficient development.
